Production-style **Cloud / DevOps / SRE portfolio project** that simulates real outages and demonstrates how to:

✅ Diagnose incidents fast  
✅ Fix root causes safely  
✅ Rotate & archive logs  
✅ Automate remediation  
✅ Generate audit reports  

Designed for Ubuntu EC2 + NGINX environments.

## 🔥 Scenario

Imagine it's **2AM and production is failing**:

• API returning 5xx errors  
• Disk almost full  
• Users complaining  

This toolkit helps you:

1️⃣ Diagnose fast (triage)  
2️⃣ Fix root cause (cleanup/rotation)  
3️⃣ Prevent repeat incidents (automation + archival)

# 🧰 Toolkit Components

## 🩺 triage.sh

Incident investigation script that gathers system + application signals into one report.

### Checks
- Last 20 application errors
- 5xx response counts
- Top failing endpoints
- Disk usage
- Memory usage
- CPU load
- System uptime
- Recommendation section

### Output
reports/triage-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv

---

## ♻️ logrotate-lite.sh (UPDATED)

Lightweight **production-safe log cleanup + archival automation**.

### 🚀 Features
- Triggers when disk usage > 70%
- Removes DEBUG lines before rotation
- Rotates all *.log files
- Compresses rotated logs (.gz)
- Uploads archives to AWS S3
- Deletes:
  - *.log older than 7 days
  - *.gz / *.tar.gz older than 7 days
- Calculates space saved
- Prints summary
- Generates CSV audit report
- Cron friendly (Friday 10PM schedule)

### 📊 CSV Report
reports/logrotate-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv

Columns:
timestamp,disk_used_percent,files_rotated,files_uploaded,files_deleted,size_before,size_after,space_saved_mb,s3_path

Perfect for:
- audits
- metrics
- interview proof
- operational visibility

---

## 🧪 generate-logs1.sh (NEW)

Realistic log generator for safe local testing.

### Generates
- 5 active service logs
- 15 additional .log files
- 15 rotated .gz archives
- 9 archives dated 20+ days old (for retention testing)
- INFO / DEBUG / ERROR logs
- 5xx responses
- failing endpoints

### Purpose
Simulates production behavior so you can:
- test rotation logic
- simulate disk pressure
- validate deletion rules
- test retention safely

No real logs required.
